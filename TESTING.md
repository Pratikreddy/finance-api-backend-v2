# Testing Documentation

## Overview
This document captures comprehensive testing for the Astryx AI Microservice, including API response format updates, Exa search integration, and end-to-end conversation flows.

## Testing Timeline
- **Initial Refactoring**: July 10, 2025
- **Exa Integration**: July 17, 2025
- **Environment**: Local development (localhost:8001)
- **Python Version**: 3.12 (using venv)

## Part 1: API Response Format Refactoring

### Changes Summary

**Before:**
```json
{
  "output": {
    "answer": "Strategy explanation only",
    "code": "```pinescript\n//@version=5\n...\n```",
    "visualizations": ":::dual\n```jsx\n...\n```\n:::",
    "chatsummary": "...",
    "conversation_id": "...",
    "tokens_used": 0,
    "cost": 0
  }
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "output": {
    "answer": "# Complete Strategy\n\n[All content including code and visualizations]",
    "chatsummary": "User requested X. Provided Y with Z.",
    "whatsapp_summary": "Key NIFTY levels: Support at 25,000. Resistance at 25,250. Strategy details included.",
    "conversation_id": "...",
    "tokens_used": 6394,
    "cost": 0.0444
  }
}
```

### Key Requirements Achieved
- ✅ NO EMOJIS in responses
- ✅ Natural WhatsApp summaries
- ✅ LLM-generated content (not programmatic)
- ✅ All content integrated in answer field
- ✅ Proper token tracking and cost calculation

## Part 2: Exa Search Integration

### Integration Summary
- Added real-time web search capabilities
- Integrated `exa_search` and `exa_find_similar` tools
- Enhanced agent to handle financial market queries
- Maintained backward compatibility

### Test Results - Market Queries

#### Query: "What are the latest updates on NIFTY 50?"
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/chat/invoke \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-user-uuid: test-user" \
  -d '{"query": "What are the latest updates on NIFTY 50?"}'
```

**Response:**
- **Tokens**: 11,260
- **Cost**: $0.0648
- **WhatsApp Summary**: "NIFTY 50 closed at 25,212.05 (+0.06%) with support at 25,000 and resistance at 25,300. Bank Nifty outperformed at 57,168.95 (+0.28%). India VIX at 11.24 indicates low volatility."
- **Result**: Successfully retrieved current market data with technical levels

### Performance Metrics
- **Average Response Time**: 15-20 seconds for market queries
- **Success Rate**: 100% during testing
- **Token Usage**: 10K-50K depending on query complexity
- **Cost Efficiency**: $0.05-0.25 per complex query

```json
{
  "conversation_id": "c653169c-48e4-4f67-9def-4c177ac3bc0a",
  "thread_name": "Chat - 2025-07-17 12:37"
}
```

#### 2. First Message - Market Analysis
```bash

  -H "x-user-uuid: demo-user-123" \
  -d '{
    "query": "What are the key support and resistance levels for NIFTY 50?",
    "conversation_id": "c653169c-48e4-4f67-9def-4c177ac3bc0a"

#### 3. Follow-up with Context
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/chat/invoke \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-user-uuid: demo-user-123" \
  -d '{
    "query": "Based on those levels, what trading strategy would you recommend?",
    "conversation_id": "c653169c-48e4-4f67-9def-4c177ac3bc0a"
  }'
```
**Result:**
